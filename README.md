# Project Euler solutions
A collection of Python solutions to Project Euler problems (in keeping with their rules on sharing the first 100)

As part of an effort to enhance my own coding skills, I'm running through the first 100 [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) problems and sharing solutions.

These are *not* optimized and mostly represent my first attempt. Please feel free to review, contribute, make suggestions, etc.
